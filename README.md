# etch-a-sketch
The websites is part of a project given as an assignment in Odin Projects. 
The webpage presents 256 squares (16 X 16)by default on loading. 
But user can enter number of squares they want and the webpage updates to present "user number' X 'user number number' of pixels (maximum limit ot user number is 100). 
When the user moves thier mouse over the pixels, it trigges a “hover” effect so that the tht particular pixel changes color as the  mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
--------------------------------------------
Extra credit (Version 2):
Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value entirely.
Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
